Chimokel only started running a year ago, in April, to pay for her children's education. Now, in Kenya, she is a hero and an inspirational person.

1. Her mother died — one year later.
2. She left school — one year ago.
3. She married Benjamin — when she was sixteen.

We use the past simple to talk about finished actions and situations in the past. We know, and often say, the time of the action or situation.

### 5b
Complete these grammar notes with the verbs in Exercise 5a.

You add *-ed* to the infinitive to make the past simple of most verbs. These are regular verbs, e.g. ¹_______.

Sometimes you only add *-d*, e.g. ²_______. We also sometimes make a spelling change, e.g. ³_______.

Many common verbs in the past simple are irregular. We don't add *-ed*. We use a different word.
e.g. ⁴_______

### 5c
How do we make negatives, questions and short answers? What is different when the verb is *be*? Look at Track 1.6 on page 150 and check.

## 2.2 CREATIVE LIVES

### Frida Kahlo (1907–1954)

Frida Kahlo was a Mexican painter. Her colourful paintings show her powerful feelings about herself and the world around her. Some of her recent fans include Madonna and Robert de Niro.

#### Life

Her life began and ended in Mexico City. When Kahlo was six years old, she had a serious disease (polio) that damaged her right leg forever. However, she was a clever and determined young woman and went to one of the top schools in Mexico. When she was fifteen, she met the famous painter Diego Rivera. He was doing a painting on a wall at her school at that time. Then, at the age of eighteen, Kahlo was in a terrible accident. She was travelling on a bus when a tram crashed into it. She began to paint while she was recovering from the accident because she was bored in bed. During the rest of her life she had over 30 operations to try to correct her physical problems.

In 1929, she married Diego Rivera but their relationship was often stormy. Soon after she got married, Kahlo started to wear traditional Mexican clothes and jewellery, and she also started to wear her hair high on her head. She visited the United States and France, and met many important people. While she was staying in Paris, she appeared on the front cover of Vogue magazine. When she wasn't working, she liked singing and telling jokes at parties.

#### Work

Kahlo produced about 200 works in her life. Many of them were self-portraits – a mixture of dreams and reality. In them, we can see that she was very proud of Mexico. Her paintings also tell us about politics, power relationships between rich and poor countries, Eastern and Western philosophy and the position of women in society. Many people admired her work, including Pablo Picasso.

## GRAMMAR: past continuous

We use the past continuous to talk about a longer background action in the past, when a shorter action interrupts it or happens during it. We use the past simple for the shorter action.

b) She began to paint while she **was recovering** from the accident.

We also use the past continuous on its own to talk about actions in progress in the past. We often use a time expression when we do this.

*He was doing a painting on a wall at her school* **at that time**.
*'What were you doing* **at eleven o'clock last night?'**
*'I was watching TV.'*

## WRITING SKILLS: keeping a learning diary

It is a good idea when you are studying English to keep a learning diary. Writing makes our thoughts and feelings clearer. It gives us thinking time and helps us to organise our ideas. It also helps us to make plans and to see our progress and development. Writing about our learning can help us become better learners.

### Thursday 20th October

This morning we learned how to use phrases like *So do I* and *Neither do I*. Jane's a good teacher. She explained everything well and in the class I understood perfectly. Now, I'm not so sure! I need to look at the lesson again tomorrow – perhaps with my classmate Gozem – she's really clever and helpful! I'm glad I decided to come to this school (the teachers and students are great) and at the moment I'm very happy here.

### Friday 21st October

Today I had lunch with some of my classmates and we spoke a lot of English! Afterwards, Gozem and I studied together and she helped me with the homework. I now realise that I enjoy working with other people like this – it's fun and I learn better than on my own.

### Sunday 23rd October

I think my listening is getting better. I had a lot of trouble with it until I came here. This evening I watched a film in English on TV. At first, I didn't understand much, but then I started to understand what the people were saying. I wrote down some of the expressions they used in my vocabulary book.
